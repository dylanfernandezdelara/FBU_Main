## Overview
### Description
FindFood is an app that makes it easy to find the location of food trucks near you! It looks up your current location and provides a map of where the nearest food trucks are along with their hours and a menu. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Travel / Food
- **Mobile:** Uses real-time location to allow users to find places to eat on the go.
- **Story:** Everyone wants to find great places to go eat and we all know small businesses usually have some of the tastiest food. This makes it easier for the consumer and the producer.
- **Market:** The app would be targeted at those who are looking to try new places to eat. 
- **Habit:** Travelers could use this as a go to app in order to find hole in walls in areas they aren't familiar with. Locals can use this app to discover new food trucks they have never eaten at before.
- **Scope:** The core feature of this app would be using real-time location and the Google Maps API. I wouldn't need to create this API from scratch, so completing the core functionality of this app is well within the scope of this program.
